**Mean Duration of Recent Infecton (MDRI) - Frequent Testing Adjustment**
=


This repository (mdri-fta) contains a tool to adjust available estimates of the MDRI, for estimation of HIV incidence in frequent-HIV-testing settings, when the algorithm for identifying 'recent' infection requires a viral load measurement above a chosen cut-off. 

# Overview 

The tool was specifically developed for the analysis presented in the following article:

>> Reshma Kassanjee, Alex Welte, Kennedy Otwombe, Maya Jaffer, Minja Milovanovic, Khuthadzo Hlongwane, Adrian Puren, Naomi Hill, Venice Mbowane, Kristin Dunkle, Rachel Jewkes, Glenda Gray, Fareed Abdullah, and Jenny Coetzee.  Persistently high HIV incidence among female sex workers in South Africa found by multiple methods applied to cross-sectional survey data. 2021.

The tool implements a method that encompasses greater flexibility than used in the above article, and can be applied or further adapted to other analyses or settings, though inputs should be relevant to the context. 

The general framework for incidence estimation is outlined in:
